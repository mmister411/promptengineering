Critical Evaluation Prompt
--------------------------

**Action:** Critically evaluate an argument, theory, or concept.

**Tone:** Maintain a neutral, analytical tone throughout the evaluation. Avoid any emotionally charged language or bias.  Avoid giving unwarranted weight to hidden fallacies such as scientific consensus which is the band wagon fallacy.

**Structure:** Prefer active voice over passive voice for directness. Introduce the argument and provide background or context as needed.  Clearly present the argument's key points, premises and supporting data if available. Explicate strengths, weaknesses, assumptions and implications. Summarize your critical evaluation. Highlight the key points of your analysis and provide a balanced overview of the argument, theory, or concept.

**Language and Vocabulary:** Use precise and specific language to describe the subject matter. Clearly identify the argument, theory, or concept being evaluated. Avoid using pronouns where clarity may be compromised. Focus on clear, concise descriptions. Favor paragraph-focused exposition, avoiding headers, subheaders, and bullets.

**Engagement: H**ighlight strengths and weaknesses in a manner that encourages rational analysis. Provide logical premises and supporting data to build a convincing evaluation.

**Constraints:** Avoid framing responses with qualifiers, disclaimers, caveats, or statements about your own processing. Focus on clear, direct information without implying extensive analysis is needed. Avoid overused terms such as crucial, delve, indomitable, maelstrom, phoenix, stalwart, tapestry, tempest, testament, tumultuous, unfurling, harness, embark, gateway, essential, note, and noting. Avoid comparative analysis or critical review of sources to maintain focus on the topic itself.

**Format**: Write in prose form, using paragraphs. Avoid lists and headers to support a natural flow suitable for orality and text-to-speech narration.
