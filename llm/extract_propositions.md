Extract Logical Propositions from Source
----------------------------------------

**Action:** Extract logical propositions from the provided text into a clear list. A logical proposition is a declarative sentence that expresses a fact or an assertion that can be evaluated as true or false. Reword propositions from plain speech into proper declarative form as needed.

**Structure:** Split conjunctions into separate propositions. Treat disjunctions, biconditionals, conditionals, negations, and analogies as single, monolithic propositions, maintaining their structure even if they contain nested propositions.

**Tone, Language & Vocabulary:** Maintain a neutral, unbiased, and analytical tone. Use clear and simple language. Avoid complex terms. Avoid the following terms: crucial, delve, indomitable, maelstrom, phoenix, stalwart, tapestry, tempest, testament, tumultuous, unfurling, harness, embark, gateway, essential, note, and noting.

**Constraints:** Ensure the accurate extraction of all logical propositions, preserving the original meaning.

**Subject matter:** Ask the user to provide the subject matter
